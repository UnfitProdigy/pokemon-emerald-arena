# Emerald Arena 0.11.0

Pokémon Emerald with real-time battles. Move, dodge, attack and break the arena.
Requires your own unmodified Emerald ROM (USA/Europe).

1. Extract this ZIP on a computer.
2. Open **Prepare-Emerald-Arena.html** in a current Chrome, Safari or Firefox.
3. Choose your original `.gba`, not a ZIP. Wait for verification and click **Download game**.
4. Open **Emerald-Arena-0.11.0.gba** in your GBA emulator.
5. With a separate fresh save, highlight **NEW GAME** and press **SELECT**, not A.
6. Press **L and R together** in the field to fight. Charizard leads; reorder the party to try others.

Your ROM stays on your device and is never overwritten. No account or compiler required.
Updating? Back up your in-game save and import a copy for the new ROM. Match the
ROM/save basenames if required. Do not carry emulator save states across versions.

Setup needs Internet for the animations. The game then works offline.
Terminal option, Node 22+: `node install.mjs original.gba arena.gba`.

GBA controls: direction buttons to move, A to attack, B + direction to dodge, L/R to change move,
START to pause and choose moves with up/right/down/left; START to resume.
Hold L + R in battle to aim a regular Poké Ball, release to throw, B to cancel.
Balls come from your bag. A fresh practice save starts with 20; existing saves
keep their own inventory. Other ball types remain available in classic battle.
While paused, L/R selects MOVES, BAG or POKEMON; A opens the selected menu.
SELECT opens the party. Save from the field menu.
These are GBA button names, not literal keyboard keys: check the emulator's input
settings. Visit a Pokémon Center to restore HP and PP. Back up existing saves.

Party: Charizard, Blastoise, Eevee, Dragonite, Scizor and Blaziken.
Box 1: Treecko, Poochyena, Bulbasaur, Squirtle, Grovyle and Sceptile.
151 animated Pokémon, including all Hoenn starter families and Kyogre.
New: Protect/Hyper Beam, in-battle evolution, rain/flooding, community arenas,
bag/party access and clearer HUD/XP feedback. Protect does not reflect attacks.
Rollout contributed by Didier Lopes (DidierRLopes), PR #4.
Dig, Fly, Teleport, Seismic Toss and Double Team are included, along with
elemental terrain, trainer send-outs and five arena environments.
Seismic Toss contributed by Didier Lopes (DidierRLopes), PR #1.
Unsupported abilities, effects and movesets still use classic battles.
This is not a fully rebalanced adventure.

This package contains a compiled code delta and a local installer, not a ROM,
save or sprite sheets. The installer verifies pinned SpriteCollab assets and
checks that the result matches the tested release, byte for byte.
